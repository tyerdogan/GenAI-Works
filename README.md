# Generative AI Projects

A lightweight repository for my **Generative AI** work, including course assignments and personal experiments.  
The focus is on building and testing practical GenAI workflows.

## What’s inside
- **Course (Master's ) projects / homework**
- **Personal prototypes & experiments**
- **Reusable notebooks and small utilities**

## Notes
This repo is a work-in-progress and will be updated as new projects are completed.
